# mapreduce
This is about creating a zoom animation on a mandelbrot set with a MapReduce Function in Hadoop.

## How to run it in IntelliJ
1. Clone this project into a folder
2. Import the project as a gradle proejct
3. Let IntelliJ do the magic

I haven't created an automatic build task for creating a jar and running it directly via hadoop jar. Sorry...
